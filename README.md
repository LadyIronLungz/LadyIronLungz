- 👋 Hi, I’m @LadyIronLungz
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about linux, developer tools,.. coding in general I suppose. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about installing code readers on my chromebook os Acer 311 which has Juniper/Junos of course which I just learned today that it isn't compatibale with any of the art softwares I would prefer using. I'm gonna keep trying til something gives or I give up of course. ;)
